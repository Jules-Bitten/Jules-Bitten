- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Julia Bittencourt, I'm currently starting my journey in programming but already have a previously bacharel degree in Law. 
- ğŸ‘€ I'm really a beginer but I am intrested in data privacy 'cause that's my line of reseach in law, LGPD and other subjects on the same path and area. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, css and javascrip, but what can I say other than "I know nothing"? haha
- ğŸ“« I don't really know yet what I'm doing here but I intend to find out. If you need to reach me (I don't know why would you but here we are), try mail me on jbitten.13@outlook.com.<br>
  have a nice day :)
